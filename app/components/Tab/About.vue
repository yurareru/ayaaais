        Hallowwww my name is Aya. I really love fish and wish I was born one. I
        love my friends, family, pets, lover, and myself. I want to be a famous
        artist and get noticed by Eve, my idol! I hope I can make a lot of
        amazing artworks for people to love and enjoy, and I hope I can get into
        an art college. Thank you for visiting my page and checking out my
